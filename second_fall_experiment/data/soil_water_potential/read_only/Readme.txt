3 CR1000's were used to measure matric potential (one in each treatment).

the "CR_1000_GH_<Trt>_Matric_<pbus>.dat" files contain data from Meter Group, Teros 21, matric potential sensor and the Irrometer Watermark 200SS.
Temperature measured on Teros 21 was used for soil temperature correction on Watermark sensors

Columns:
PTemp		panel temperature on CR1000 sampled at timestamp.
Mp_1_Avg	matric potential (kPa) measured by Teros 21. Average of 1 sec scans for 15 min preceding timestamp
Tp_1_Avg	soil temperature measured by thermistor on Teros 21. Average of 1 sec scans for 15 min preceding timestamp
WM_Avg		matric potential (kPa) measured by Watermark 200SS. Average of 1 sec scans for 15 min preceding timestamp
ohms_Avg	raw resistance from watermark. Average of 1 sec scans for 15 min preceding timestamp


CR1000_GH_A_159 Teros 21 and Watermark readings were measured in pot D-11
	File contains data for whole experiment. 


CR1000_GH_D_158 Teros 21 and Watermark #1's were in pot M-7. Teros 21 and Watermark #2's were in pot M-10.
	No data after 11/1/19 @ 15:00. Data logger began recording again 12/19/19 when sensors were removed. 

CR1000_GH_BC_901 Teros 21 and Watermark were in pot W-6. Clay wrote this down at end of expiriment. 
	No sensor readings after 11/27/19 @ 14:30.
